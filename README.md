# FITS Cataloger

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** October 4, 2025

A cross-platform astrophotography image management system for cataloging and organizing FITS files with automated metadata extraction, session grouping, and web-based review interface.

Intended use - upload captured FITS images to a "quarantine" location on the server.  AstroCat will monitor that folder for new images, scan the metadata and attempt to organize the images to a storage folder of your designation.  Images are automatically grouped into Imaging Sessions based on the capture date and imaging rig (telescope, camera, filter, etc.) in use.  Imaging rigs are hashed ID's but are repeatable for the same equipment, so that sessions captured using the same equipment can be easily identified.

You can then use the web interface to group images into "processing sessions".  AstroCat will attempt to locate the most relevant calibration data and pre-stage those files for you on the server for your processing delight.  Add and edit notes relating to both Imaging Sessions and Processing Sessions using Markdown formatting.

Direct access to the sqlite database is provided courtesy of sqlite-web and markdown editing is available via a rich interface courtesy of ToastUI-Editor.

NOTE: This app was created for my own convenience.  The image scanning and processing routines currently only support FITS files generated by Sequence Generator Pro and have only been tested against my own library of images and workflow.  Other software may be compartible but has not been tested.  No promises this will work for you.  If you try it and it works, let me know!  If you try it and it doesn't work, also let me know... I just may not have time to change anything for you.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository and navigate to directory
cd fits_cataloger

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or: venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Initialize configuration
python main.py init-config

# Edit config.json with your paths
nano config.json
```

### Configuration

Update `config.json` with your directory paths:

```json
{
  "paths": {
    "quarantine_dir": "/path/to/quarantine",
    "image_dir": "/path/to/images",
    "processing_dir": "/path/to/processing",
    "database_path": "/path/to/fits_catalog.db",
    "restore_folder": "/path/to/restore"
  }
}
```

Add your equipment to `cameras.json`, `telescopes.json`, and `filters.json`.

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Test database connection
python main.py test-db

# Scan quarantine folder once
python main.py scan

# Start continuous monitoring
python main.py monitor

# View database statistics
python main.py stats

# Organize files into structure
python main.py organize
```

### Web Interface

```bash
# Start web server
python main.py web

# Access at: http://localhost:8000
```

**Web Features:**
- Browse and filter FITS files
- Review imaging sessions with metadata
- Create processing sessions
- Manage equipment database
- Configure application settings
- View real-time statistics

### Processing Session Management

```bash
# Create processing session
python main.py processing create "M31 Project" --file-ids 1,2,3,4

# List processing sessions
python main.py processing list

# View session details
python main.py processing show <session-id>
```

## Architecture

### Database Models
- **FitsFile** - Core FITS metadata and location tracking
- **Session** - Imaging session grouping and notes
- **ProcessingSession** - Project-based file organization
- **Camera/Telescope/FilterMapping** - Equipment specifications
- **SystemSettings** - Application configuration

### Key Components
- `main.py` - CLI entry point
- `fits_processor.py` - FITS metadata extraction
- `file_monitor.py` - Quarantine directory monitoring
- `file_organizer.py` - File migration and organization
- `web/app.py` - FastAPI web application
- `models.py` - SQLAlchemy database models
- `config.py` - Configuration management

### Folder Structure

Organized images follow this pattern:
```
images/
├── YYYY-MM/              # Year-Month
│   └── telescope/        # Telescope name
│       └── object/       # Target object
│           ├── Lights/
│           ├── Darks/
│           ├── Flats/
│           └── Bias/
```
